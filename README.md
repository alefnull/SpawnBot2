## 🔍 About <a name = "about"></a>

SpawnBot2 is a poor imitation of [@xwcg\'s](https://twitter.com/xwcg "https://twitter.com/xwcg") original [SpawnBot](https://github.com/xwcg/SpawnBot "https://github.com/xwcg/SpawnBot") (AKA Herobrine).

I began recreating it in order to learn node.js and discord.js (and to see how far GitHub Copilot could take me), and I hope to continue to improve upon it over time.

If you find any bugs or have any feature requests, please feel free to submit an issue. pull requests are also welcome.
